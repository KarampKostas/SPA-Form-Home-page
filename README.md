Clone the project,for VS Code, from this repository.

In terminal run the command: 'npx json-server --watch db.json --port 8000' to connect with the json server and then run the command 'npm run server' to start the server.

Finally, run 'npm start' and the project will start in the localhost

For the validation part, besides to not the input fields are empty, i added a validation for usernames and passowords to match with the records. The usernames are :

richard32,
dorothy32,
nathan32,
megan32,
dominic32,
melanie32,
trevor32,
claire32,
rich32,
helen32,

The password for each one username is the same as the username(e.g. username:richard32,passowrd:richard32)
